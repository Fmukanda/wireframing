# Wireframe
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint of a digital product—such as a website, mobile app, or software interface—before detailed design and development begin. It outlines the structure, layout, and key elements of each screen without focusing on colors, graphics, or stylistic details.

#### Why is wireframing important in a design process?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process for the following key reasons: 
  - **Clarifies Structure and Functionality:** It helps designers and stakeholders visualize how the different components of a page will be arranged and how users will navigate through the site.
  - **Facilitates Collaboration:** Wireframes serve as a common language for designers, developers, and clients.
  - **Saves Time and Resources:** Identifying and fixing usability issues in the early wireframing stage is significantly cheaper and faster than making changes during development or after a product has launched. It prevents costly rework and ensures the final product is built on a solid foundation.
  - **Iterative Design:**  Wireframes are quick to create and easy to modify, which encourages rapid iteration and testing of different layout ideas.
  - **Scopes Functionality:** It helps define what features and interactive elements are needed, which is crucial for accurate project planning and development estimates.
